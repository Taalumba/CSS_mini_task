<h1>Wonderwall</h1>
<h2>By: Oasis</h2>

<h3>Verse 1:</h3>
<p class="verse">
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you<br>
And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
</p>

<h3>Verse 2:</h3>
<p class="verse">
And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out<br>
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
</p>

<h3>Pre-Chorus:</h3>
<p class="pre-chorus">
And all the roads we have to walk are winding<br>
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding<br>
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how<br>
</p>

<h3>Chorus:</h3>
<p class="chorus">
Because maybe<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
And after all<br>
You're my wonderwall<br>
</p>

<h3>Verse 3:</h3>
<p class="verse">
Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you<br>
And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you're not to do<br>
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now<br>
</p>

<h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
<p class="pre-chorus">
And all the roads that lead you there were winding<br>
And all the lights that light the way are blinding<br>
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how<br>
</p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p class="chorus">
I said maybe<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
And after all<br>
You're my wonderwall<br>
I said maybe (I said maybe)<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
And after all<br>
You're my wonderwall<br>
</p>

<h3>Outro:</h3>
<p>
I said maybe (I said maybe)<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)<br>
</p>
